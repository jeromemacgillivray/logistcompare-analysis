For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n        function is(valueA, valueB) {\n            if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) return !0;\n            if (!valueA || !valueB) return !1;\n            if (\"function\" == typeof valueA.valueOf && \"function\" == typeof valueB.valueOf) {\n                if (valueA = valueA.valueOf(), valueB = valueB.valueOf(), valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) return !0;\n                if (!valueA || !valueB) return !1;\n            }\n            return !(\"function\" != typeof valueA.equals || \"function\" != typeof valueB.equals || !valueA.equals(valueB));\n        }\n        function deepEqual(a, b) {\n            if (a === b) return !0;\n            if (!isIterable(b) || void 0 !== a.size && void 0 !== b.size && a.size !== b.size || void 0 !== a.__hash && void 0 !== b.__hash && a.__hash !== b.__hash || isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) || isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) || isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)) return !1;\n            if (0 === a.size && 0 === b.size) return !0;\n            var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n            if (isOrdered(a)) {\n                var entries = a.entries();\n                return b.every(function(v, k) {\n                    var entry = entries.next().value;\n                    return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n                }) && entries.next().done;\n            }\n            var flipped = !1;\n            if (void 0 === a.size) if (void 0 === b.size) \"function\" == typeof a.cacheResult && a.cacheResult(); else {\n                flipped = !0;\n                var _ = a;\n                a = b, b = _;\n            }\n            var allEqual = !0, bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k) {\n                if (notAssociative ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n        function is(valueA, valueB) {\n            if (valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) return !0;\n            if (!valueA || !valueB) return !1;\n            if (\"function\" == typeof valueA.valueOf && \"function\" == typeof valueB.valueOf) {\n                if (valueA = valueA.valueOf(), valueB = valueB.valueOf(), valueA === valueB || valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB) return !0;\n                if (!valueA || !valueB) return !1;\n            }\n            return !(\"function\" != typeof valueA.equals || \"function\" != typeof valueB.equals || !valueA.equals(valueB));\n        }\n        function deepEqual(a, b) {\n            if (a === b) return !0;\n            if (!isIterable(b) || void 0 !== a.size && void 0 !== b.size && a.size !== b.size || void 0 !== a.__hash && void 0 !== b.__hash && a.__hash !== b.__hash || isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) || isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) || isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)) return !1;\n            if (0 === a.size && 0 === b.size) return !0;\n            var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n            if (isOrdered(a)) {\n                var entries = a.entries();\n                return b.every(function(v, k) {\n                    var entry = entries.next().value;\n                    return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n                }) && entries.next().done;\n            }\n            var flipped = !1;\n            if (void 0 === a.size) if (void 0 === b.size) \"function\" == typeof a.cacheResult && a.cacheResult(); else {\n                flipped = !0;\n                var _ = a;\n                a = b, b = _;\n            }\n            var allEqual = !0, bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k) {\n                if (notAssociative ?
